RASB-berry Property Investors, a real estate investing business is seeking to expand it's market share by investing in a few properties. King County is on the radar and the company decided to seek to develop a new competitive edge throughout this phase of expansion by becomming a data-driven company. Thus, they decided to hire the consulting services of data scientists to provide data-driven recommendations on how to enter and behave within the target market. In this project, we're diving deep into the King County House Sales dataset to understand what makes properties profitable in King County's real estate market. Our main aim is to provide valuable insights to property investors who want to make smart investment decisions. We'll be looking at various aspects of properties, like their size, number of bedrooms, and condition, to see which factors have the most impact on the sale prices of houses. By doing this, we hope to help investors optimize their strategies and increase their chances of getting better returns in the King County real estate market.



## Business Understanding

In this phase of expansion, RASB-berry Property Investors seeks to enter the realestate market of the pacific northwest, and specifically Seattle Washington and the surrounding area (i.e. Kings County). Before begining any projects in the area, RPI decision makers need to better understand how to determine the opportunity cost, and potential returns for any investments made in Kings County, as well as how to maximize those returns. The oportunity cost and potential returns can indeed be determined by understanding how time, physical location, and physical condition and property attributes all affect the price of a real estate property. 

Therefore, this anaylisis will seek to build a statistical model that is informative as far as specifiying what metrics to use and how strong each metric may be in terms of predicting the market value of a real estate property.
